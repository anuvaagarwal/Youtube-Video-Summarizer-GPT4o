# YouTube Video Summarizer

This project is a Python-based tool that summarizes YouTube videos using the OpenAI API. It processes YouTube video transcripts to create brief, comprehensive summaries that capture the main ideas and key takeaways.

## Features
- **YouTube Transcript Processing**: Retrieves transcripts from YouTube videos using the YouTube API.
- **Detailed Summarization**: Utilizes the OpenAI API to condense the transcript into concise, readable summaries.
- **Behavioral Change Insights**: Demonstrates a use case focused on "Atomic Habits" by James Clear, highlighting key behavioral change principles in the summaries.
- **API Integration**: Supports both the YouTube API for transcript extraction and the OpenAI API for natural language processing.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites
- **Python 3.8+**
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup).
- **YouTube Data API Key**: Obtain a YouTube API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

### Python Packages
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install openai requests
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-video-summarizer.git
   cd youtube-video-summarizer
   ```

2. **Set up API Keys**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI and YouTube API keys:
     ```env
     OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
     YOUTUBE_API_KEY="your_youtube_api_key"
     ```

3. **Update Notebook for Your Use Case**:
   - Open `Oct12_2024_ai_project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   - Modify any relevant cells to align with your desired YouTube video and summarization preferences.

## Usage

1. **Run the Notebook**:
   - Execute each cell in the notebook to download the transcript, process it, and generate the summary.

2. **Example Output**:
   - The notebook contains examples focused on summarizing key principles from "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.
   - Example summaries generated:
     - **Main Themes**: Overview of behavior change concepts, habit loops, and the impact of small improvements over time.
     - **Laws of Behavior Change**: Summaries include insights on making habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying.
